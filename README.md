# 🌱 SustainaGov AI

SustainaGov AI is an AI-powered assistant that helps Indian citizens
understand government sustainability schemes related to clean energy,
water conservation, and environmental sustainability.

## 🎯 Problem
Information about government schemes is scattered across multiple portals
and written in complex language, making it difficult for common citizens
to understand and benefit from them.

## 💡 Solution
This project uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve verified
scheme information and generate structured, easy-to-understand answers
using a local AI model.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- FAISS Vector Database
- Sentence Transformers
- Ollama (Local LLM)
- Streamlit
- Python
